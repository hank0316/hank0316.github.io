Our new preprint [AdaSearch: Balancing Parametric Knowledge and Search in Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16883) is out! We investigate how LLM search agents should *balance* parametric knowledge and search, and propose **AdaSearch**, a framework that teaches agents to explicitly decide *when* to search via RL. It achieves superior **self-knowledge awareness** without complex reward engineering, and provides **transparent decision-making rationales**.
