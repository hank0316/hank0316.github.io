MS Student @ [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/)  
Visiting Research Intern @ [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/)  
**<font color="#f00">Seeking PhD positions for Fall 2026!</font>**

I am an M.S. student at the Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/). I am also currently a visiting research intern at the University of Virginia, advised by [Prof. Yu Meng](https://yumeng5.github.io/).

I received my bachelor’s degree from National Taiwan University, during which I worked with [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) and [Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/).

**Research Focus:** My research centers on natural language processing, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). I am interested in developing LLMs and agents that are **resource-efficient** and **reliable**.

Nowadays, I think about:
1. **Language Agents**: 
    - **Trustworthiness**: Beyond task completion, how can we make the behavior of agents more interpretable and faithful to users? 
    - **Efficiency**: How can we control or reduce unnecessary search calls in long-horizon search agents (e.g., DeepResearch agents)? How should we quantify and balance the trade-off between reasoning and search?
2. **Self-Improving/Self-Evolving AI Systems**:
    - **Conditions for Autonomous Improvement**: What are the necessary conditions for an AI system to reliably and sustainably self-improve?
    - **Alignment**: How can we ensure that self-improving systems remain aligned with human values as they surpass the level at which humans can easily provide direct supervision?
    - **Verification and Evaluation at Scale**: How can we efficiently verify and evaluate progress on long-horizon, open-ended tasks that are inherently difficult to assess (e.g., scientific research agents)?

**Misc:**
When I am not doing research, I like to listen to different genre of musics, especially Blues, Rock, and Grunge.
I'm a huge fan of John Mayer and I love to play eletric guitars!
